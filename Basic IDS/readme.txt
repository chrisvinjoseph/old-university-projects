A (very) basic intrusion detection system. 
Takes in base data, sample data and a list of events to look for. It then determines if sample data is anomalous.
This was done as a solution for a university assignment. For the most part, this project does not have or
reflect much of a real world use since it is so bare bones. 
I just put it in this directory for the sake of having it in here.

Run command:

python3 IDS.py EVENT_NAME_FILE BASE_DATA_FILE TEST_DATA_FILE
