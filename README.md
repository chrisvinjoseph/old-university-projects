# old-university-projects
A repo where I store old assignments I have done at university.

Each folder contains a project along with a readme explaining it.
These are here only as a showcase of sorts and should not be used for anything else.

Important Note:
These are slightly edited (for ease of viewing) but for the most part, they are my original submissions.
This means that there are very few of the frills that one would expect from a fully functioning version
of the same program e.g. the RSA parameter generator only generates relatively small keys, well below the
standard for RSA.
This is due to the fact that in most instances, only specific features and optimizations score marks. Therefore,
generally I leave out features that score no marks.
